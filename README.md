This contains a Google Colab file that answers some questions I came up with when looking at the dataset.
1.	What anime has the most episodes?
2.	What Anime Arcs covers the most time in the show.
How I went about finding the answer to my first question was by createing a pie chart showing the pie slice sizes in correlation to the number of episodes to represent what anime is bigger.
and to find my second answer to my question I made a histogram of each of the Arcs, and the anime's total episodes.
